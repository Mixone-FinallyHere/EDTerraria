## About

This is a playable & moddable Terraria 1.3 source. We only intend on using it for modifications and source improvements. By default the source will stay Terraria-like, as in: nothing custom to change gameplay.

EmuDevs Team worked hard to get it to this stage and we're working hard to clean up and improve the source. We just need testers and possible contributors!
